# Teaching numerical methods with IPython notebooks

#### A tutorial prepared for SciPy 2014

Instructors: David Ketcheson and Aron Ahmadia  
Monday, July 7 1-5 p.m.

https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2014/schedule/presentation/536/

## Outline

- Motivation
  - Inquiry-based learning
  - Numerical methods as a craft
- Getting started
  - Sage Math Cloud
  - The IPython Notebook (basics)
    - If most attendees are familiar, skip this
    - mention that students should type all the code
  - Using SMC collaboratively
  - Distributing notebooks
    - nbviewer
    - SMC
  - Methods for collecting notebooks
    - Add instructor as collaborator
    - E-mail
    - nbviewer
    - in-class presentation
- Using the notebook
  - Visuals
    - Images
      - best to use Markdown
    - Plotting
      - matplotlib
      - plotly for interactive plots
      - others? (Bokeh)
    - Animations and widgets
      - JSAnimation
      - IPython widgets
  - nbconvert
    - presentations
    - handouts
  - Styling modifications
    - outline running cells
    - group code and output
- Examples of notebooks for teaching
  - A single short concept (Aliasing)
  - A homework exercise or in-class activity (finite differences)
  - A lesson or laboratory session (multigrid)
  - A short course: HyperPython
- Time for participants to design their own notebooks (and share them?)
